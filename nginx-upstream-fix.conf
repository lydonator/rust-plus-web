# NGINX Upstream Fix for Single Instance
# Replace lines 7-13 in /etc/nginx/sites-available/rustplus

# OLD (causing timeouts):
# upstream cloud_shim_backend {
#     least_conn;  # Route to instance with fewest connections
#     server 127.0.0.1:4001;
#     server 127.0.0.1:4002;
#     server 127.0.0.1:4003;
# }

# NEW (single instance):
upstream cloud_shim_backend {
    # Load balancing disabled until additional instances are ready
    server 127.0.0.1:4001;
    # server 127.0.0.1:4002;  # Disabled - not running yet
    # server 127.0.0.1:4003;  # Disabled - not running yet
